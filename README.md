# Sberbank-Kaggle-Competition
My submission for the Sberbank Realty House Price Prediction competition hosted by https://www.kaggle.com/
    In this competition, Sberbank is challenging Kagglers to develop algorithms which use a broad spectrum of features to predict realty prices. Competitors will rely on a rich dataset that includes housing data and macroeconomic patterns. An accurate forecasting model will allow Sberbank to provide more certainty to their customers in an uncertain economy.
