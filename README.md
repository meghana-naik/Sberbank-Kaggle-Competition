# Sberbank-Kaggle-Competition
My submission for the Sberbank Realty House Price Prediction competition hosted by https://www.kaggle.com/ . 
    In this competition, Sberbank challenged Kagglers to develop algorithms which used a broad spectrum of features to predict realty prices. Competitors relied on a rich dataset that includes housing data and macroeconomic patterns. An accurate forecasting model allowed Sberbank to provide more certainty to their customers in an uncertain economy.
